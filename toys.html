      <p>
        I decided to brush up my knowledge on the math behind artificial neural
        networks, and these are the notes that I've taken along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The appendix contains a collection of notations, definitions, and theorems
        from the fields of linear algebra and calculus that are used throughout
        the document.

      <h3>Yet Another Continuous Extension of the Collatz Function</h3>
      <img src="collatz/collatz.jpg" alt="Visualization of a continuous extension of the Collatz function" />
      <p>
        I have found a continuous extension of the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz function</a>
        which seems to have no cycle besides <code>(1;2)</code>
        and its fixed points, and which converges to 1 even from the close
        vicinity of its positive real fixed points, usually with lower stopping
        times than other continuous extensions. I have rendered a few nice
        visualizations of it on the complex plane.
